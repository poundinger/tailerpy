# tailerpy
This code is used to automatically generate cloth patterns from body measurement. 

## To do
- Find the way to neatly export the pattern. Currently it export the whole pattern as an svg file.
- I connect point by point manually. In principle, I should create a boundary based on given points.
- Find more patterns
- Organize definitions. Write classes or module if have time.
